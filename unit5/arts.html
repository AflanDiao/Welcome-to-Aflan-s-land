    <h1><em>我 我<br>真 会<br>Art  的 搞<br>,  会 真<br>Can  搞 的<br> I  艺 艺<br>?  术 术<br>吗 吗<br>? ?</em></h1>
    <h3>我迷茫过；我被否定过；我被质疑过
        <br>I've been lost; I've been denied; I've been questioned
        <br>我灵光一现过；我被认可过；我被喜欢过
        <br>I had an Epiphany; I've been recognized; I was liked
    </h3>
    <p><br><br>我不想为了他人的审美去做那些“艺术作品” 我一直都这么说
        <br>I don't want to make "works of art" for other people's aesthetic.
        <br>但是我会去浏览其他艺术家的作品，去学习。这跟我自己的想法有壁吗？我真的不知道，所以迷茫。
        <br>But I would look at other artists' work and learn. Does that have anything to do with my own thinking? I really don't know, so confused.
        <br><br>幼儿园我就在画画，一直到现在了。
        <br>I have been drawing since kindergarten.
        <br>好多老师都说我有天分，但高中的老师不认为，她否定我质疑我。
        <br>A lot of teachers said I was talented, but the teacher in high school didn't think so. She denied me and questioned me.
        <br>可能她也没想到，我好像莫名更有自信，想创造更多。越挫越勇，这个词形容得对。
        <br>Maybe she didn't expect it either, but somehow I felt more confident and wanted to create more. The more you go down, the braver you are. That's the right word.
        <br><br>来英国读书了，这里适合我。
        <br>Came to England to study, here suits me.
        <br>这么多年，我尝试了这么多种艺术形式，油画画过，雕塑做过，插画画过，摄影拍过......
        <br>Over the years, I've experimented with so many forms of art, including painting, sculpture, illustration and photography......
        <br>万万没想到，在这我找到了我还算感兴趣的让我确认我想继续深入下去的那部分。虽然我现在不能说是很擅长，但我想努力。
        <br>Unexpectedly, here I found the part that I was mildly interested in and confirmed that I wanted to go further. I can't say I'm good at it right now, but I want to try.
        <br><br>家里很支持我搞艺术。
        <br>My family is very supportive of my art.
        <br>我特感谢他们，他们热爱我的作品，他们愿意跟所有人分享。其他人也喜欢诶，我想得到，但每次都不敢相信。
        <br>I'm so grateful to them, they love my work and they want to share it with everyone. Other people like it, too. I want to, but I can't believe it every time.
        <br>我感谢所有人。
        <br> I thank everyone.
        <br><br>我总有一天！会如鱼得水的搞艺术，也会搞出真的艺术！
        <br>One of these days! I will do art like a fish in water, will also make real art!
    </p>
    <h3><br>“At least I did one thing right”我喜欢这句词
        <br>"At least I did one thing right" I like that.
        <br>是的，我做的决定，好像是一件正确的事情。
        <br>Yes, I made a decision that seemed like the right thing to do.
