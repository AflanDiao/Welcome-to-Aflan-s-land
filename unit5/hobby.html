    <p><br>好像日子真的很无聊，但排除上学两点一线的时候，我努力的在生活中找到对我来说增加兴奋点的事物。
        <br>It seems like the days are really boring, but instead of going to school, I try to find something in my life that adds excitement to me.
        <br>很好，庆幸，我找到了它们，还是有羁绊的它们。从一个里找到了另外一个。
        <br>Good, I am glad to found them, they still have a bond. From one to the other.
        <br><br>所以这就是我想聊聊这些的原因，特别有趣，可能也仅仅对我来说......
        <br> So that's why I want to talk about these, especially interesting, and probably just for me......
        <br><br>我追星追的那个人，且叫他Y吧，其实我知道他已经有1900+天了马上就2000天了，但偏偏今年我才被他更加深刻吸引。他是个搞唱跳的🎤💃，原先是个爱豆来着，现在在参加音乐节，自己办巡演，我去看了。特别幸福。而他在生活中常常跟我们分享运动日常，甚至他热爱极限运动，到这是不是你也猜到了，对喽，我开始感受到健身和运动的爽感，是因为他。
        <br>The man I am after, let's call him Y, in fact, I know he has been 1900+ days soon 2000 days, but this year I was more deeply attracted to him. He's a singer and dancer. He used to be a love bean, but now he's on a festival tour. I went to see him. Very happy. And he often shares sports daily with us in life, even he loves extreme sports, to this is not you have guessed, yes, I began to feel the sense of fitness and sports, because of him.
        <br><br>我减肥，成功了！我开始跑去健身房，去做从没想过的撸铁🏋🏻‍♀️。夏天，甚至去攀岩🧗和冲浪🏄了～
        <br> I lost weight and I did it! I started hitting the gym and doing weights I never thought I'd do. In summer, I even went rock climbing and surfing.
        <br><br>再聊聊旅游？嗯。这个是从小到大的
        <br>Talk about travel? This one grew from young to now.
        <br>今年特意给自己安排了空白时间，但没想到有机会去了那么多的地方。空中飞人是我🙋‍♀️
        <br>This year, I deliberately arranged a blank time for myself, but I did not expect to have the opportunity to go to so many places. Skyman is me.
        <br><br>🛫泰国🇹🇭-法国🇫🇷-意大利🇮🇹-英国爱丁堡🇬🇧-北京🇨🇳-成都-美国🇺🇸-日本🇯🇵-韩国🇰🇷-哈尔滨🛬
        <br>Thailand - French - Italian - Edinburgh - Beijing - Chengdu - U.S. - Japan - South Korea - Harbin
        <br>在旅行中，有家人有朋友，幸福！游历万水千山的感觉真好，一切都是浪漫的起源，享受再享受。
        <br>In the travel, have family and friends, happiness! It feels so good to travel the mountains, everything is the origin of romance, enjoy and enjoy.
        <br><br>是不是要点题了：去泰国的时候看了演唱会，同时吃到了最爱的泰餐，也玩了水；
        <br> Is it necessary to point out: When I went to Thailand, I saw the concert, and ate my favorite Thai food and played with water;
        <br>喜欢韩国爱豆，所以去了韩国，买了好多特产，也看了他们生活的地方，仿佛我们曾在一起。
        <br>I like Korean love beans, so I went to South Korea, bought a lot of specialties, and also saw where they live, as if we had been together.
        <br>这是不是就是羁绊，追星的契机让我想到可以到达更多地方，让我享受游历。
        <br>Is this the connection, the opportunity to follow the star makes me think of more places to go, let me enjoy the travel.
        <br><br>🎮说到游戏，我不擅长，也没有瘾
        <br>When it comes to games, I'm not good at them and I'm not addicted to them.
        <br>那为什么我会写上来呢？答案是：因为每次玩游戏都是跟我最爱的朋友们一起呀～我跟他们一块干什么我都愿意，都特别开心，说到这我想他们了，要准备见见他们去，等我哦💞
        <br>Then why did I write it up? The answer is: because every time I play the game is with my favorite friends ah ~ I do with them I am willing to do, are particularly happy, speaking of this I miss them, want to prepare to meet them, wait for me.
